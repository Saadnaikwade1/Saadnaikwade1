## Hi there 👋
✏️## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Saad A. Naikwade**, an aspiring **Full Stack Web Developer** currently focused on mastering the **MERN stack**.

I come from an Electronics & Communication Engineering background, and I'm now transitioning into software development. I'm passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

Currently, I'm enrolled in a 6-month Full Stack Developer course where I'm learning:

- ✅ HTML & CSS for structuring and styling websites  
- ✅ JavaScript for interactivity  
- ✅ React.js for dynamic frontends  
- ✅ Node.js & Express.js for building scalable backend APIs  
- ✅ MongoDB for handling databases

I'm committed to learning by doing, working on projects, and contributing to open source whenever possible.

Let's connect and build something awesome together!
